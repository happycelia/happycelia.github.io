**The final betrayal and the dead of the night**

It has been eight years since the first paranormal activity that took place in Silicon Valley. By now, the teenagers have all grown up, however some remained loyal to their friends and some chose to betray them such as Jenna Smith. For those who don’t know, Jenna was Lena’s childhood best friend and later on became everyone’s best friend. Although previously she has shown no doubt of her faith, now she is turning against her family, religion and friends. Last year, as a seventeen year old Jenna was betrayed by her beloved friends ; Lena, Darcy and Matthew. They had to leave her behind because they had no choice, since finding out that she was possessed. However, Jenna did not take it that easily, for she thought they could have at least waited for her. A lot has changed within the year, Jenna has no longer had any contact with the group of friends nor did she ever see her family again. Her father reported many times that she did not even come home for Christmas. The police found no evidence of where or what she went through, however the teenagers knew exactly where she was. As the six friends passed the remote forest in Northern California once and for all, they were strangled and the first person they saw in the distance was Jenna Paige Smith. 

Hayden: Jenna? 

Samantha: oh my God! Jenna is here, guys I think we might be………….

Jake: Jenna is here! I think this was part of my dream as well, be prepared because she is not here to help. She is with them. 

Darcy: will you stop talking for once!!! Jenna, we missed you - where on earth did you go? 

The teens looked up at her. The last time they saw her, it was the start of the year and she was standing side by side with Cornelia and Raven. Since then, her appearance has changed a lot. From the beautiful green eyes to the bushy brunette hair, her trademark has faded. Her long, bushy hair has now been evaluated into dark brown and her green eyes were now grey. The freckles she always joked about as a teenager has now faded and her pink cheeks was now grey. 

Samantha: please, Jenna get us out of here. 

Jenna (bitterly): why should I? You had the courage to leave me in there. 

Hayden: it is not the same. You need to get us out of here, we can unite together to get this over with, once and for all. And then all the freedom we wished for will be fulfilled. 

Jenna: you sound ‘better’ monotone robot!
Lena: I thought……..we were friends!!

Jenna: I thought so too. But at last we were both wrong. 
Lena: do you remember? We made a vow to never leave each other’s side nor stab each other in the back. 
Jenna: of course I remember. Like what you said Darcy, things change! 

Darcy felt the instant pin of guilt. He remembers twelfth grade, he was the one who convinced the others it would be appropriate to leave the possessed Jenna by herself. He did not know how or what to respond, it is after all his fault that Jenna was condemned into losing trust. It was his fault that the root of Jenna’s soul being turned against her will. 
Matthew (angry): things does. Just like you having the guts to tell Raven about us, you know she was after you as well? She didn’t just want to hunt the six of us, you were in the pack of victims as well. DON’T YOU REMEMBER THAT? 

Jenna: I am going to summon Raven. Good luck on the blessings Lena and Matthew, may Christ save your neck now. 

Samantha: she kills us and you will be next! Don’t you think you are now officially her priority, she is using you to get us and then kill you afterwards. 
Jenna: seems fair. 

Lena, instead of arguing with her ex-best friend like the others, she apologizes for what she did to her as an eighteen year old. 

Lena (remorseful): look Jenna, I am sorry for what I did. Back then I believed it was the only choice, not knowing the water was the cure. We thought leaving you behind would be the only way of keeping us safe, and I am sorry. I was selfish and inconsiderate, I forgot about the vows we made as children the instant second Darcy mentioned the idea. 

Darcy winced as Lena continued to make her confession. He knew it was all down to him for an apology. But he could not do so, Jenna may suffered betrayal from her dearest friends but that was no excuse for her murdering 20 people. 

Lena: so, Jenna I wanted to say I am very sorry. Please do not give up your family and religion for my sake. You are a wonderful person and I never thought I would have been able to grow up as an adult without you by my side. For thirteen years of our friendship, I cannot imagine what my childhood would have been like without you. 

Jenna seems to have been touched by what she said. However, she was not going to let those sorrowful emotions control her goals. Her goal was to get her six friends to be here so she could summon the witch. 

Jenna: you should have thought so before you did it, Lena. And I don’t entirely blame you, those dickheads didn’t make it any better. 

Matthew: I am sorry too. I promised you that the day I will never turn my back and I did. 

Jenna: I have to summon her. There is no stopping. I know you guys are just apologizing in order to save your own necks. I am not having my proposals destroyed. 
*From earth you came, now may be fulfilled, As the godly is fading and Satan is entering. May he be safe on his way to his journey, watched over by others and kept away from harm. I now summon Ravenna Annalisa Cushion, the one who supports you through your journey. May her presence be shown to those who turns their back at him and pray to condemn him for he who died for the freedom he believed in.. I now call for the one and only, if she could show herself to these people, it would be great*. 
After muttering a whole lot of evil, satanic prayers in figure appeared from the distance. The figure of what looked like a killer demon mixed with an old hag appeared at Lena’s sight. They knew it was Raven, and this time they have no chance of escaping. Growing up being hunted by a demon, Lena knew the strategies of escaping, however she never faces them herself. 

Lena: you have no idea what you just did, Jenna. 

Jenna: oh yes I did. You see, this is what I have always been made to do, it wasn’t to be with you assholes, it was to do something as memorable as this. 

Hayden: YOU TRAITOR!
