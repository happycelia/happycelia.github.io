Ravenna grew up in a society of strong feudalism between 1515-1545. Where her family were nobles, who owned the knights and people. As a young girl, she indulged lavishing and privileged life from her parents. With people from their land who bowed and greeted her every single day. Her parents who would often buy her expensive gifts and held balls for her birthdays. However, she did not get along with her siblings, often fighting for the throne. Ismelda murdered her older sister, leaving her younger daughter Cornelia. Nevertheless, Ismelda sentenced Cornelia to a land far away before she knew her mother. While Ravenna was alive, she was married and lived in the manor. Along with her sister Ismelda, who never ended up marrying any men, for they knew she was using them.



Ravenna’s husband, who she thought was the most trusted, was called Hayden. Who later on had a son called Mathew. Ravenna grew fond with her son; while her husband was tend to be out. She took so sedulous watch of her, that she sometimes tells her sister to step out. Ismelda however knew that her sister was spoiling her eight years old son. After almost a decade of life, Mathew died. It all happened with Hayden; his father left the land, with Ravenna and Ismelda gone on an errand to the monarch. Mathew was on the horse, when he fell down and was stabbed by a hunter. After the sisters returned, Ravenna was heart-throbbed to see her son lying there, with no hope of breathing.




After her son’s death, she spend the next three years in depression, and her husband found no relief towards her illness. She would sit near the grave where her son was buried every night, with no response whenever her sister, her husband or the house cleaners call her. Until in 1544, when she found her sister, Ismelda and Hayden making out. Having that thought that night, and finding out made her feel betrayed and stabbed in the back. After seeing it, Hayden and Ismelda decided they would move somewhere far, far away. Where Ravenna would be left inside the mansion, with all her possession.
Being betrayed and heart-broken, she found in this world, there was no such thing as love or faith. She felt like all her kindness and trust to god and this world were all gone. Ravenna even wrote “Darkness is what this really is, my life is gone, seas are off the shore”. In 1545, Ismelda and Hayden remarried and had a daughter, named True. After receiving that news, Ravenna got out a knife and stabbed herself in the back.




All three people: Ismelda, Ravenna and Hayden came back as ghosts after they were dead. Ismelda and Hayden haunted the palace, resembles the mansion where they got married. However, Ravenna haunted her own house, with no disturbance apart from the tourisms. As a ghost, she was called the Black Lady, for she often wore black mantle in the spiritual world, and her behavior were cynical. The villagers would see her every night, and she would scream at them, or sometimes ignore those who got lost. Ravenna lost contact with her sister or Hayden after she was dead. However, she stay inside the mansion, haunting the grave, searching for her lost baby. Hoping that one day, she might be able to see Mathew again.
